There are a few ways to install and run C++ (or any other programming
languages) from windows. For me at least, the easiest by far is to use
the windows subsystem for linux (wsl).
This essentially gives the best of both worlds - allowing you to (for
example) use windows tools to manage and edit code, while still having
full access to linux tools for compiling and running the code.
