title: Using linux from within windows: ubuntu bash, compiling c++, and more

There are a few ways to install and run C++ (or any other programming
languages) from windows. For me at least, the easiest by far is to use
the windows subsystem for linux (wsl).\
This essentially gives the best of both worlds - allowing you to (for
example) use windows tools to manage and edit code, while still having
full access to linux tools for compiling and running the code.

Note: this method is not actually using windows to compile or run the
code (you are running linux from within windows) - so if you're trying
to test your code to see if it will compile and run properly in windows,
this is not for you.\
If you just want to use and write code easily from within windows, and
use linux tools to compile and run it, then this is the best and easiest
solution I've found.
