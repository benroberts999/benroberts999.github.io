title: Superb Fairywrens, Morton National Park
---


A male superb fairywren feeding its chicks in Morton national park, NSW. The nest was built on the ground, nestled within a patch of stinging nettle plants. (Note, the nest was just off a walkway between our campsite and the toilet - I only noticed the nest because I saw the adult fly down there to feed the chicks. I didn't leave the walkway or approach the nest, I have a very long lens.)
