title: "Talk at the Perimeter Institute: Searching for dark matter with GPS and global networks of atomic clocks"
---


I gave an invited talk at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical physics as part of the New Directions in Dark Matter and Neutrino Physics workshop:
"Searching for dark matter with GPS and global networks of atomic clocks."

[Slides available here]({{ site.baseurl }}/slides/1707-GPSDM-Perimeter-small.pdf).
A video of the presentation is available on the PIRSA archive: [PIRSA Number: 17070027](http://perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/searching-dark-matter-gps-and-global-networks-atomic-clocks)
