We used the GPS constellation as a ~50,000 km aperture dark matter detector to search for dark matter in the form of domain walls. Each of the GPS satellites contains an atomic clock. If dark matter interacts with regular matter, it may perturb the clock, allowing us to search for dark matter-induced "glitches" in the clock timing data.
We didn't find anything, allowing us to place stringent constraints on certain dark matter models.
