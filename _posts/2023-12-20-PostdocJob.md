We have a postdoc position open:

### Postdoctoral Research Fellow - Atomic Theory

* [Apply here](https://uq.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/uqcareers/job/St-Lucia-Campus/Postdoctoral-Research-Fellow---Atomic-Theory_R-33242)

We invite applications for an outstanding Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the Precision Atomic Theory Group at UQ. This position is funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project "Probing new physics with atomic parity violation". The successful candidate will work with Associate Professor Jacinda Ginges and Dr. Benjamin Roberts on development of atomic many-body methods and computer codes at the forefront of precision theory for heavy atoms. Applications will be made to fundamental and applied problems, including precision searches for new physics beyond the standard model, probes of nuclear structure, superheavy elements, and atomic clocks. The candidate will have the opportunity to collaborate with Professor Magdalena Kowalska at ISOLDE-CERN.

Visa sponsorship may be possible. Ideally, we hope the successful candidate can commence in March; however, we are willing to negotiate for the right candidate.

Applications close 21 January 2024 at 11.00pm AEST (R-33242). Please note that interviews have been tentatively scheduled for early February.
