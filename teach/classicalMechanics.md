A brief overview of the foundations of classical mechanics.

## Lecture Notes

* [Classical Mechanics]({{ site.baseurl }}/teach/classical/ClassicalMechanics-BMRoberts.pdf)
  * Overview of foundations of classical mechanics
  * Langrangian, Hamiltonian formulation, Noether's theorem, Poisson brackets and more

## Texts

* Goldstein, Poole, and Safko, _Classical Mechanics_
  * One of the standards, for good reason; very solid and thorough coverage.
* Landau and Lifshitz, Mechanics (Vol. 1)
  * An older and technical book. A very elegant coverage of classical mechanics. More appropriate at a slightly more advanced level.
