An introduction to foundations of Classical Mechanics and Classical Field Theory

## Lecture Notes

* [Classical Mechanics]({{ site.baseurl }}/teach/classical/01-ClassicalMechanics-BMRoberts.pdf)
  * Overview of foundations of classical mechanics
  * Langrangian, Hamiltonian formulation, Noether's theorem, Poisson brackets and more
* [Classical Field Theory]({{ site.baseurl }}/teach/classical/02-Fields-BMRoberts.pdf)
  * Relativity: invariance of the interval, Lorentz transformations etc.
  * Classical field theory: scalar and vector fields, interactions
  * Electrodynamics, covariant Maxwell's equations
  * EM waves and radiation
  * Motivation for general relativity:

## Texts

* Goldstein, Poole, and Safko, _Classical Mechanics_
  * One of the standards, for good reason; very solid and thorough coverage.
* Landau and Lifshitz, Mechanics (Vols. 1 and 2)
  * An older and technical book. A very elegant coverage of classical mechanics. More appropriate at a slightly more advanced level.
* D. J. Griffiths, Intoduction to Electrodynamics
