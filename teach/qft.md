## PHYS4040 (Quantum Field Theory - scalar fields)

First part of the course, focus on quantising scalar fields

### Whiteboards from the 2024 lectures

The lectures follow the course notes quite closely, and cover much the same material as David Tong's lecture notes (linked below).

## PHYS6004 (Advanced Quantum Field Theory - quantum electrodynamics)

Extremely brief overview to QED. First, covers a recap of Dirac theory.
Then states quantisation of Dirac and photon fields (without proof).
Feynman rules are motivated and stated (not derived) - we will see the derivation in the later parts of the course.
Finally, a semi-relativistic treatment of the Lamb shift is given (following paper of Bethe), which shows an example of infinities in the theory and how to deal with them (renormalisation)

### RQM/QED Lecture Notes

* [Relativistic Quantum Mechanics]({{ site.baseurl }}/teach/qed/RelativisticQM-BRoberts.pdf)
  * Contains: quick overview of Dirac theory
  * QED overview, summary of Feynman rules
  * Semi-relativistic treatment of Lamb shift, renormalisation

### Textbooks

* Peskin & Schroeder, _An Introduction To Quantum Field Theory_
  * Main book for the course, available as pdf from library
* Sakurai, _Advanced Quantum Mechanics_
  * A little dated, but very nice. Available from library
