  * PHYS6004 (Advanced Quantum Field Theory)

Extremely brief overview to QED. First, covers a recap of Dirac theory.
Then states quantisation of Dirac and photon fields (without proof).
Feynman rules are motivated and stated (not derived) - we will see the derivation in the later parts of the course.
Finally, a semi-relativistic treatment of the Lamb shift is given (following paper of Bethe), which shows an example of infinities in the theory and how to deal with them (renormalisation)
