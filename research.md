**_ARC DECRA Fellow, University of Queensland, Australia._**
Working in theoretical atomic physics and particle astrophysics. My research focusses on high-precision atomic structure calculations, and how atomic processes can be used for testing fundamental theories, probing for physics beyond the standard model, and searching for dark matter.
Previously at SYRTE, the Observatoire de Paris, France, working on possibilities for dark matter detection using high-precision atomic clocks, and the University of Nevada, Reno, as part of the GPS.DM Collaboration.
PhD in theoretical atomic physics from UNSW, Australia, in Sydney.
