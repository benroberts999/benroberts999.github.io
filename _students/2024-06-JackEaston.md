Jack works on developing and extending high-precission atomic structure theory methods for applications in fundamental physics.
In particular, for low-energy tests of the Standard Model, and searches for fundamental symmetry violations.

**Honours Thesis:** Theoretical calculation of Stark-induced polarisabilities in heavy alkali atoms for low energy tests of the Standard Model
