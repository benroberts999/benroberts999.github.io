In a recent Letter [B. K. Sahoo, B. P. Das, and H. Spiesberger, Phys. Rev. D *103*, L111303 (2021)], a calculation of the parity violating 6S-7S E1 amplitude in Cs is reported, claiming an uncertainty of just 0.3%. In this Comment, we point out that key contributions have been omitted, and the theoretical uncertainty has been significantly underestimated. In particular, the contribution of missed QED radiative corrections amounts to several times the claimed uncertainty.
