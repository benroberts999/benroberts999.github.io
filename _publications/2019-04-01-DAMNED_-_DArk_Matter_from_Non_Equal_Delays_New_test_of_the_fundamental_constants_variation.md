"DArk Matter from Non Equal Delays‚Äù (DAMNED) is a new experiment that aims to check for space or time variation of physics fundamental constants. This 3 arm Mach-Zender experiment allows us to compare an ultra-stable cavity to itself in the past through the delay created by a multi kilometer long optical fiber. A massive scalar dark matter field (DM) would be seen on the experiment beat and we aim to constrain a new combination of the DM coupling constants.
