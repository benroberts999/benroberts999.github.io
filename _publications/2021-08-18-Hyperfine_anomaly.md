We report on our calculations of differential hyperfine anomalies in the nuclear single-particle model for a number of atoms and ions of interest for precision atomic tests of the standard model. It is shown that comparison with available experimental data allows one to discriminate between different nuclear magnetization models. The nuclear single-particle model leads to significantly better agreement with experiment than the routinely-used uniform ball model, and we advocate its use in future studies of the hyperfine structure. These results have implications for the uncertainty analyses of atomic structure theory that forms a critical part of the interpretation of precision atomic measurements, including the atomic parity violation measurement in cesium.
