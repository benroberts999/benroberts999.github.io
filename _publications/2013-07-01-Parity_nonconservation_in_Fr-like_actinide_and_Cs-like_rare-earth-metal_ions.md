Parity nonconservation amplitudes are calculated for the 7s-6d transitions of the francium isoelectronic sequence (Fr, Ra +, Ac 2+, Th 3+, Pa 4+, U 5+ and Np 6+) and for the 6s-5d transitions of the cesium isoelectronic sequence (Cs, Ba +, La 2+, Ce 3+ and Pr 4+). We show in particular that isotopes of La 2+, Ac 2+ and Th 3+ ions have strong potential in the search for new physics beyond the standard model - the PNC amplitudes are large, the calculations are accurate and the nuclei are practically stable. In addition, 232-Th 3+ ions have recently been trapped and cooled [C. J. Campbell _et al._, Phys. Rev. Lett. **102**, 233004 (2009)]. We also extend previous works by calculating the s-s PNC transitions in Ra + and Ba +, and provide new calculations of several energy levels, and electric dipole and quadrupole transition amplitudes for the Fr-like actinide ions.
