We perform calculations of s-d5/2 nuclear-spin-dependent parity nonconservation amplitudes for Rb, Cs, Ba+, Yb+,Fr, Ra+,and Ac2+. These systems prove to be good candidates for use in atomic experiments to extract the so-called anapole moment, a P-odd T-even nuclear moment important for the study of parity-violating nuclear forces. We also extend our previous works by calculating the missed spin-dependent amplitudes for the s-d3/2 transitions in the above systems.
