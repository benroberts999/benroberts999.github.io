We use the previously developed radiative potential method to calculate quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections to energy levels and electric dipole transition amplitudes for atoms which are used for the study of the parity nonconservation (PNC) in atoms. The QED shift in energies and dipole amplitudes leads to noticeable change in the PNC amplitudes. This study compliments the previously considered QED corrections to the weak matrix elements. We demonstrate that the QED corrections due to the change in energies and dipole matrix elements are comparable in value to those due to the change in weak matrix elements and therefore must be included.
