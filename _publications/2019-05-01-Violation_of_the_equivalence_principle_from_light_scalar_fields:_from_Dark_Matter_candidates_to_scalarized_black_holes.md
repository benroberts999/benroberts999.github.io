Tensor-scalar theory is a wide class of alternative theory of gravitation that can be motivated by higher dimensional theories, by models of dark matter or dark ernergy. In the general case, the scalar field will couple non-universally to matter producing a violation of the equivalence principle. In this communication, we review a microscopic model of scalar/matter coupling and its observable consequences in terms of universality of free fall, of frequencies comparison and of redshifts tests. We then focus on two models: (i) a model of ultralight scalar dark matter and (ii) a model of scalarized black hole in our Galactic Center. For both these models, we present constraints using recent measurements: atomic clocks comparisons, universality of free fall measurements, measurement of the relativistic redshift with the short period star S0-2 orbiting the supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center.
